# Advanced Railscasts Syntax Theme

My experiment to create a syntax theme that employs some [advanced highlighting techniques][advanced] that are only available to Atom.

This theme is based upon the [Railscasts theme by Ryan Bates][railscasts] and the [Base16 Railscasts theme][base16] by Chris Kempson.

## EXPERIMENTAL

This theme is to be considered *highly* experimental. Released versions may contain annoying color combinations, flashing text, strange animations or other weirdness. Side effects may include:

* Nausea/vomiting
* Piercing pain in the eyes, head and/or neck
* Rash or other irritation of the skin, mouth, nose and/or throat
* Loss of consciousness or "missing time" episodes
* Desire to gouge out one's own eyes
* Temporary or permanent insanity

You have been warned. :wink:
